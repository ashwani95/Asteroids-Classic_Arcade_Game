# Asteroids
This is classic arcade game asteroids played by the kids in 80's, 90's and some of us (including me) even now.

This game was built by me in my sophomore year when i was trying to get my hands dirty learning python.

The game uses [simplegui](http://activeed.rice.edu/comp160/docs.html) library developed at Rice University.

The game is hosted here : http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user39_o0kHBnaQ3R_9.py

My highest score is 95000, try to beat that :p
